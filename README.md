# particle-accelerator
A simulator for a particle beam accelerator. Developed as C++ project for the course "Programmation II" for physicists, given by Jean-CÃ©dric Chappelier at EPFL (spring semester 2011).

The program reads the variables for the simulation (such as the elements of the accelerator, number of beams and particles, time-step etc.) from documents/simulation.txt, and displays a graphical visualization using the wxWidgets toolkit and openGL.
